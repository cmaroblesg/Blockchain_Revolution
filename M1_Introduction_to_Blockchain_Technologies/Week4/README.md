# The Blockchain Ecosystem
## Introduction
Although blockchain technology emerged from the open source community, it quickly attracted many stakeholders, each with different backgrounds, interests, and motives. In this module, you will explore the roles and perspectives of nine categories of stakeholders within the blockchain ecosystem, including industry pioneers, venture capitalists, developers, governments, regulators, leaders, and end users.

## Learning Objectives
* Describe nine categories of stakeholders in the blockchain ecosystem
* Describe three levels of blockchain stewardship (i.e. the platform level, the application level, and the ecosystem level)
* Explain how various categories of stakeholders influence the governance of a blockchain ecosystem
