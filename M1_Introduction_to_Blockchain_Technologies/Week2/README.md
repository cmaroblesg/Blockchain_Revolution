# Blockchain Design Principles
## Introduction
We believe that the next era of the digital economy can be shaped around a set of blockchain design principles, which can be used for creating software, services, reinventing business models, markets, organizations, and even governments. This module frames the blockchain revolution around seven design principles. For each principle we describe a current problem to be solved, identify “blockchain breakthroughs” to these problems, and discuss the implications of these breakthroughs on the digital economy. We hope that these design principles will assist learners in contemplating their roles and their futures in the blockchain revolution.

## Learning Objectives
* Characterize the blockchain revolution in terms of seven design principles
* Explain how various consensus mechanisms (e.g. proof of work, proof of stake) achieve network integrity
* Compare and contrast distributed vs. centralized systems
* Identify various forms of incentive within a blockchain network
* Explain the role of asymmetric cryptography (i.e public and private keys) in securing a blockchain network
* Explain how privacy is achieved on a public blockchain
* Explain how blockchain technology can be used to verify and enforce property rights—both real and intellectual
* Describe some of the ways that blockchain supports financial inclusion
