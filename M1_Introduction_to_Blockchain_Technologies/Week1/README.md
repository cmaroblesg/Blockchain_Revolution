# The Second Era of the Internet
## Introduction
The Internet connects billions of people around the world, and is great for communicating and collaborating online. However, because it was built for moving and storing information, and not value, it has done little to change the way we do business. Now, for the first time in human history, two or more parties anywhere in the world can transact and do business peer to peer using the blockchain. In this module we introduce blockchain as “the trust protocol,” and explain how it represents the second era of the Internet. We describe how blockchain technology establishes trust—not through powerful intermediaries, but rather through collaboration, cryptography and clever code.

## Learning Objectives
* Identify the limitations of the Internet for business and economic activity
* Describe the relationship between bitcoin and blockchain
* Explain how trust is established in a pre- and post-blockchain world
* Identify the steps in a blockchain transaction
* Define terms such as hash, miner, nonce, consensus mechanism, proof-of-work, public key cryptography

## Readings
### Recommended Tool for Course Readings
As you go through each lesson sequence, you will be provided with links to various course readings. [Hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is/) is an open-source web annotation tool that will enable you to highlight, annotate and discuss these course readings with your classmates in context (i.e. using a social layer on top of each website).

For the purposes of this Specialization, we have created a group called “[BRMOOC](https://hypothes.is/groups/xR76zqDE/brmooc).” When annotating, please make sure that our group name is properly selected.

See [this page](https://web.hypothes.is/help/quick-start-guide/) to get started with hypothes.is, and [this page](https://web.hypothes.is/help/annotating-with-groups/) to learn more about group annotations.
