# Blockchain Implementation Challenges

## Introduction
Like every revolutionary technology, the blockchain has its upside and its downside. In this module we discuss ten implementation challenges which must be overcome as we transition to the second era of the Internet. For each challenge, you will also learn about potential solutions and what we can do to ensure the fulfillment of the blockchain’s promise.

## Learning Objectives
* Describe ten challenges associated with implementing blockchain technology
* For each challenge, describe one or more possible solutions
* Explain how a 51% attack works.
