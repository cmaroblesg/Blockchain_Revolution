# Final Deliverable
## Introduction
So far in this course you have performed an industry analysis, selected a specific market segment, assessed your competition, and identified a promising opportunity for blockchain within your chosen market. As well, you have described how you will position your idea, and have given consideration to the business model decisions that need to be made in order to transform your idea into reality. In this final module, you will consolidate all of the work you have produced thus far into a final, peer-reviewed project deliverable, which you can use to pitch your idea to your organization and/or potential investors.

## Learning Objectives
* Use the feedback you have received from your peers in each of the previous modules to improve your ideas
* Consolidate each of your project milestones into a final project deliverable
* Apply what you have learned throughout this course in order to give thoughtful and constructive feedback on your peers' final deliverables
