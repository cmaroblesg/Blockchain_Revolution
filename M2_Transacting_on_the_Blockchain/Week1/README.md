#Cryptoassets

## Introduction
Blockchain is the first native digital medium for value. Consequently, we are witnessing one of the largest transformations of wealth in human history—from paper-based analog assets to digital ones. In this module, students will learn about seven different kinds of cryptoassets, including cryptocurrencies, protocol tokens, utility tokens, securities tokens, natural asset tokens, crypto collectibles, crypto-fiat currencies, and stablecoins.

## Learning Objectives
* Describe seven types of cryptoassets, including cryptocurrencies, protocol tokens, utility tokens, securities tokens, natural asset tokens, crypto collectibles, and stablecoins.
* Identify one or more examples of each type of cryptoasset.
* Explain what an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) entails.

As you go through each lesson sequence, you will be provided with links to various course readings. [Hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is/) is an open-source web annotation tool that will enable you to highlight, annotate and discuss these course readings with your classmates in context (i.e. using a social layer on top of each website).
For the purposes of this Specialization, we have created a group called “[BRMOOC](https://hypothes.is/groups/xR76zqDE/brmooc).” When annotating, please make sure that our group name is properly selected.
