# Identity
## Introduction
Accessing large, centralized systems such as email, health insurance, or a bank account requires the provision of various identifiers—for example, government-issued ID cards, self-selected passwords, or biometric data. However, identifier-based systems are problematic—both administratively and philosophically. In this module you will learn about five problems with identifier-based systems and explain how a distributed self-sovereign identity system, deployed on the blockchain, can resolve many of these issues.

## Learning Objectives
* Explain the difference between “identity” and “identifier”
* Describe five problems with centralized, identifier-based systems
* Describe the features of a distributed, self-sovereign identity system
* Explain the role of proxy contracts and controller contracts in blockchain-based identity applications
