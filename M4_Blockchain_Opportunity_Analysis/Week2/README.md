# Opportunity Identification
## Introduction
When identifying opportunities for blockchain technology within your chosen market, it is important to understand the kinds of problems that it can and cannot solve—at least in its current state. In this module, you will learn to distinguish between problems that are and are not well-suited to blockchain-based solutions. After considering various opportunities for blockchain technology within your chosen market segment, you will learn how to use a decision matrix to select the most promising idea to pursue for your final project. By the end of this week, you will clarify the purpose and objectives of your project, you will identify your target customers/audience, and you will prepare a statement of need and statement of benefit for your proposal.

## Learning Objectives
* Distinguish between problems that are and are not well-suited to blockchain-based solutions
* Brainstorm at least three ideas or applications for blockchain technology within your chosen market segment
* Use a decision-matrix to select the most promising idea for your project
* Define the purpose and objectives of your project
* Identify your target customers or target audience
* Write a statement of need and statement of benefit for your customers/audience

### How To Write a Good Problem Statement
A problem statement, also known as a statement of need, establishes the focus and rationale for your project.  A statement of need is concise (i.e. only 2-3 sentences), is backed by evidence, and explains why your project needs to be undertaken.  Potential solutions to the problem are not included here.

A good statement of need should answer the following questions:  
* What is the problem or need?
* How do you know this is a problem?
* What is the target population you are trying to serve?
* What are the needs of this population?
* Why does this problem need to be addressed now?
* Why are you/your organization the best ones to solve this problem?
* How does this problem relate to the purpose/mission of your organization?

A good statement of need should be rational (i.e. not based on emotional appeals), using facts and evidence to support claims.  Supporting data should be current, and may be qualitative or quantitative in nature.  

As part of this week’s assignment, you will be asked to submit the statement of need for your chosen project.

### Blockchain Opportunity Brainstorm
Use the following template to start brainstorming ideas for your project.  For each idea, you are asked to specify the industry/market segment you are targeting, the problem statement, your target customers/audience, and the opportunity for blockchain.  You are also asked to come up with a name for each idea.

In a subsequent lesson, you will use a decision matrix to help narrow down the ideas you generated during this initial brainstorm. By the end of this module, you will end up with one solid idea to pursue for your project.

### Problem Solving With Blockchain
The following flow chart (see link below) will help you assess whether blockchain is an appropriate solution to the problem(s) you’ve identified.  You will need to go through this flow chart for each of the ideas you generated in your “Blockchain Opportunity Brainstorm.”  

Any ideas that are not well-suited to blockchain should be eliminated, and the most promising ideas can be carried forward into the next round (i.e. the decision matrix).

### Decision Matrix
Use the following decision matrix template to select the most promising idea on which to focus your final project.  Your decision matrix should include at least five (5) relevant "Factors."  

[Decision Matrix Template.xlsx](./files/Decision_Matrix_Template.xlsx)

When you have finished tabulating the scores, highlight your "winning" idea.  

If the idea you have chosen to pursue for your final project is not the idea that received the highest score, then add some text to explain your choice.

You will be asked to share your completed decision matrix as part of this week's peer-review assignment.
