# Industry Analysis
## Introduction
Almost every industry can expect to experience a major business model disruption as blockchain technologies take hold. In this module, you will explore current applications of blockchain in various industries, and will choose one industry on which to focus your final course project. You will research examples of applications or use-cases of blockchain technology within your chosen industry, and will contribute to our Blockchain Case Commons, which will serve as a shared, continuously-evolving resource for all course participants. As well, you will perform some preliminary market research in order to identify a specific market segment within your chosen industry that shows promise for blockchain technologies.

## Learning Objectives
* Define "opportunity analysis" and explain why it is important
* Identify the industry that you will address for your Blockchain Opportunity Analysis
* Describe one or more market research approaches that could be used to assess market need
* Conduct some preliminary market research to help you identify a specific market segment that shows promise for blockchain technology
* Explain why your chosen market segment is attractive for blockchain technologies
* Identify your competitors and specify their advantages, strengths, and weaknesses
* Identify the barriers of entry for you and for other competitors in your chosen market segment

### Exploratory Market Research
Conducting some exploratory market research will allow you to scout out some of the potential problems and/or opportunities for blockchain technology within your chosen industry, and to identify the factors and variables that you will have to consider throughout your project analysis.

Use the resources below to help you identify one or more market research methods that you will employ when exploring your market.  In a subsequent reflection, you will be asked to identify your chosen research methods, and explain how and why you arrived at this decision. You will also be asked to explain why these methods are well-suited to your industry.

### Conducting Preliminary Market Research
Now that you have read about various approaches to market research and have identified your preferred method(s), it’s time to actually go out and collect some preliminary research data!  

For the purposes of this course, we acknowledge that much of your data may come from secondary sources (i.e. existing, published data).  However, if you plan on developing a questionnaire or interview protocol as part of your research, we strongly encourage you to actually write out your questions and administer them to a convenience sample of friends, family, co-workers, and/or your fellow classmates (e.g. via the discussion forum).

As part of this week’s peer-review assignment, you will be asked to describe the market research approaches you used, including the specific questions, criteria, and/or search parameters that you employed.

### How to Perform a Competitive Analysis
A competitive analysis is a form of strategic research that enables you to collect and review information about competing firms, and assess their strengths and weaknesses.  This analysis will provide you with greater context regarding the opportunities and threats that exist within your industry.

Many firms do not conduct this type of analysis systematically enough, and instead operate on informal impressions, conjectures, and intuition gained through the tidbits of information about competitors. As a result, traditional environmental scanning places many firms at risk of dangerous competitive blindspots due to a lack of robust competitor analysis.  Superior knowledge of rivals offers a legitimate source of competitive advantage.

Competitors are:
* Other organizations who offer the same product or service now
* Other organizations who offer similar products or services now
* Organizations who could offer the same or similar products or services in the future
* Organizations that could eliminate the need for a particular product or service

One approach to performing a competitive analysis is through competitor profiling.  These profiles give an in-depth description of the competitor's background, finances, products, markets, facilities, personnel, and strategies.

Use the template below to profile each of your competitors.  You will need to save a separate copy of this template for each competitor you analyze.  In this week’s peer-review assignment, you will be asked to report on your top three competitors and comment on their key strengths and weaknesses.
