# Introduction to the Blockchain Case Commons


Throughout this course, you will be researching various applications of blockchain technology within your chosen industry.  The Blockchain Case Commons will serve as a shared resource that will assist you throughout this process—specifically, during the “Industry Analysis,” “Opportunity Identification,” and “Positioning” phases of your project.

In essence, the Blockchain Case Commons (BCC) is a crowdsourced repository of blockchain applications and use-cases spanning multiple industries and sectors.  The BCC will enable you to search for and comment upon examples of blockchain technology that have been submitted by other learners in the course, and to contribute some examples of your own.

Please note that the BCC is intended for specific examples or applications of blockchain technology—not for general articles or opinion pieces about blockchain.  Examples could include blockchain protocols, platforms, DApps, smart contracts, or other distributed ledger technologies that are closely related to blockchain.
