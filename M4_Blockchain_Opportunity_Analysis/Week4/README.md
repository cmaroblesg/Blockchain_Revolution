# Execution
## Introduction
An idea may seem great on paper, however actually executing this idea will require careful consideration of various business-model decisions, including those related to funding, risk, talent, timing, corporate boundaries, and partners/allies. In this module, you will begin to think about what would be required to transform your opportunity from an idea to reality.

## Learning Objectives
* Identify the major risks that need to be addressed in order for your idea to succeed
* Define your corporate boundary decisions
* Identify who you would need on your team and the kinds of skills and experience that each of these team members would require
* Describe how you would go about attracting partners/allies to work with your company

### Designing Your Business Model
A **business model** provides the logic and rationale for how an organization creates, delivers, and captures value in economic, social, cultural or other contexts. The process of developing (and modifying) a business model is an essential part of business strategy.

**Business model design** refers to the activity of designing an organization’s business model. When an organization creates a completely new business model, the process is called **business model innovation**. Business model design includes the modeling and description of a company's:
* value propositions
* target customer segments
* distribution channels
* customer relationships
* value configurations
* core capabilities
* commercial network
* partner network
* cost structure
* revenue model

A business model design template can facilitate the process of designing and describing a business model.  One of the most widely used frameworks for describing the elements of a business model is a **business model canvas**.
Please watch the following video for an overview of the various elements of a business model canvas:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoAOzMTLP5s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoAOzMTLP5s)\
The sources listed under “Recommended Readings” provide further elaboration on the components of a business model canvas.

As part of this week’s assignment, you will be asked to submit a photo, scan, or screenshot of your completed business model canvas for your project.

### Operational Considerations
Firms implement their business model at the operational level, through their **business operations**. Consequently, an operationally viable and feasible business model requires lateral alignment with the underlying business operations.

Business operations refer to the process-level activities, capabilities, functions, and infrastructure (e.g. business processes, process modeling), organizational structures (e.g. workflows, human resources), and systems (e.g. IT architecture, production).  The outcome of these operations is the harvesting of value from assets owned by a business.  Assets can be either tangible (e.g. buildings, equipment, infrastructure) or intangible (e.g. ideas).

Taking into account how blockchain technology can enable access to unique capabilities outside corporate boundaries, organizations can now define the business operations that are fundamental to competitiveness—i.e. that are both mission critical and also unique enough to ensure differentiated value.  

As you develop the business model for your project, consider the following:
1. Are there possible partners who could do the work better? In particular, could you benefit from harnessing new peer production communities, ideagoras, open platforms, and other blockchain business models?
2. Given blockchain technology, what are the new economics of corporate boundaries—the transaction costs of partnering, versus keeping/developing in-house?  Can you develop a suite of smart contracts whose core elements are modular and reusable?
3. What is the extent of technological interdependence versus modularity?  If you can define business components that are modular, then you can easily reconfigure them outside corporate boundaries.
4. What are your organization’s competencies with regard to the managing of outsourced work?  Can smart contracts enhance those competencies and lower costs?
5. What are the risks of opportunism where a partner might encroach on fundamental parts of your business?
6. Are there legal, regulatory, or political obstacles to deeper networking (and shrinking) of your organization?
7. Speed and pace of innovation are important boundary decisions. Sometimes firms have no choice but to partner for a strategic function because they cannot develop it in-house fast enough.  A partner arrangement can be a placeholder.  Will partnering help you build an ecosystem that will improve your competitive advantage?
8. Is there a danger of losing control of something fundamental—for example, a product or network architecture? Firms must have a sense of which parts of the value chain will be key to creating and capturing value in the future. If these are farmed out, the firm will lose.
9. Is there a capability, like the exploitation of data assets, that must be part of the fabric of your enterprise and all its operations? Even though you lack a unique capability, you should view partnering as a transitional tactic to develop extraordinary internal expertise and capacity. Blockchain technologies will introduce a new set of capacities that need to reside in the cranium of every employee.  You can’t move culture outside your boundaries.
