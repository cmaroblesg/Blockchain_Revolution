# Positioning

## Introduction
In the last module, you identified a promising idea or opportunity for blockchain within your chosen market segment. This week, you will work on positioning your idea—carving out a niche or identity for your product/service within the minds of your target customers. By the end of this week, you will explain how your idea will bring new or added value to your customers, and how your idea will affect the positioning for your organization.

## Learning Objectives
* Explain which aspects of your idea will bring new value to your customers
* Write a positioning statement for your proposed idea
* Describe how your idea will change (or create) the positioning of your organization within your chosen market segment
* Explain how your organization will sustain its positioning in a competitive market

## Readings
### Positioning Your Idea

A value proposition describes what sets your idea apart from your competitors. It gives a big picture overview of the benefits a product or service provides.\
A positioning statement is the “pitch” of your value proposition.  It is more focused, and is generally created after you've developed your value proposition.

In his book, Crossing the Chasm: Marketing and Selling High-Tech Products to Mainstream Customers, author Geoff Moore provides the following formula for writing a positioning statement:
**For [target customer/audience] who [statement of need or opportunity], our [name of product/service] is [product/service category] that [statement of benefit].  Unlike [primary competitive alternative], our product [statement of primary differentiation].**

The wording of your own positioning statement doesn’t have to match this exactly, however in general a positioning statement should:
* be concise and memorable
* be tailored to your target customers/audience
* communicate how your business differs from the competition
* explain how you achieve your value
* provide compelling evidence to support your differentiation claims (e.g. reviews, data)
* align with the core values of your business
* leave room for growth

In this week’s assignment, you will be asked to explain how your project will bring new or added value to your customers.  You will also be asked to submit a positioning statement for your project.

### Strategic Positioning of Your Organization

The **strategic position** of an organization is its perceptual location relative to its competitors.  This strategy defines the company’s distinctive approach to competing, as well as the **competitive advantages** on which it will be based (Porter, 2012).\
Establishing a strategic position will enable your organization to develop a framework for resource-allocation around a clear point of focus.  The challenge for most organizations is determining which positioning strategy is most appropriate and effective. Organizations must recognize that they cannot afford to be all things to all people. Successful organizations make difficult decisions regarding the focus of their efforts. Importantly, your organization’s resources (e.g. people, equipment, supply channels, etc.) must be capable of maintaining the position once you've secured it.

An organization’s strategic position can be defined around several parameters.  The following examples were adapted from Gershon's (2012) discussion of positioning in the healthcare industry:
* **Service:**  The goal of this approach should be to establish the organization’s reputation for being customer friendly.
* **Quality:**  Historically, it has been difficult to discern the quality of a particular organization through means other than anecdotal evidence. However, in the age of big data and online performance reviews, this is changing rapidly.  Many organizations are adopting a quality position and leveraging this kind of data.
* **Access:**  A position that emphasizes accessibility focuses on attributes such as location, hours of operation, number of facilities, etc.  
* **Scope:**  How wide or how narrow a range of services an organization offers provides another positioning opportunity.
* **Innovation:**  Organizations that are on the leading edge of research and technology can establish a position based on these innovative factors.
* **Demographics:** Focusing on a particular demographic segment of the market is another approach to establishing a clear market position.

As part of this week's assignment, you will be asked to describe how your project would affect the positioning of your organization (whether new or existing).  You will also be asked to explain how you would go about sustaining this positioning once you've secured it.
