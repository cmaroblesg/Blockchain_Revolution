# Leadership for the Next Era
## Introduction
Blockchain alone is just a tool. In order for this technology to fulfill its long-term promise, humans must lead. Rather than relying on state-based institutions, blockchain must be primarily self-governed through collaborations of civil society, private sector, government, and stakeholders in non-state networks. In this module, we discuss the idea of blockchain governance networks and explain how they can support blockchain stewardship at three levels: The platform level, the application level, and the ecosystem level. As well, you will learn about the conditions that are necessary for a blockchain-based hub of innovation to succeed.

## Learning Objectives
* Explain the difference between regulation and governance
* Discuss some of the key issues, challenges, trade-offs, and future scenarios related to blockchain and regulation
* Identify the different layers comprising the blockchain technology stack and describe how these layers enable or constrain the governance of a blockchain system
* Describe ten types of governance networks
* Identify seven conditions for success of a blockchain-based hub of innovation
