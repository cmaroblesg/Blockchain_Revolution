# New Business Models
##  Introduction
There are countless opportunities for blockchain to disrupt or displace traditional centralized business models. In this module, we explore how blockchain technology can support “open networked enterprise” business models through the inclusion of native payment systems, reputation systems, uncensorable content, trustless transactions, smart contracts, and autonomous agents.

## Learning Objectives
* Define terms such as Distributed Application (DApp), autonomous agent, open networked enterprise, and distributed autonomous enterprise
* Describe seven open networked enterprise business models and explain how blockchain technology could enhance each of these models
* Describe some strategic approaches to managing intellectual property with blockchain technologies
