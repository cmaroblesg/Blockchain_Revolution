# Blockchain and the C-Suite
## Introduction
Because blockchain changes the deep structures and architecture of the firm, it will consequently transform our models of management and the roles of the C-Suite. Navigating the balance between blockchain’s hype and its true potential is a key responsibility of an organization’s management team. In this module, you will learn about some of the decisions and changes that business leaders can anticipate when considering how the future of blockchain will unfold within their business.

## Learning Objectives
* Explain how blockchain will transform the roles and functions of the C-Suite (e.g. CEO, CFO, CMO, CIO, CHRO, COO, CLO)
