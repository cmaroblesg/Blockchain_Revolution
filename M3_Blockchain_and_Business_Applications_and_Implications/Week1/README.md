# Re-architecting the Firm

## Introduction
The corporation represents a pillar of modern capitalism. With the rise of a global peer-to-peer platform for identity, trust, reputation, and transactions, we will be able to re-engineer deep structures of the firm for innovation and shared value creation. In this module, we explore blockchain’s role in decentralizing the enterprise and its implications on the roles and boundaries of the firm.

## Learning Objectives
* Explain how blockchain enables the decentralization of the enterprise
* Identify four kinds of transaction costs of a firm and explain how blockchain reduces these costs
* Describe three ways that blockchain search differs from Internet search
* Describe some of the factors that firms should consider when defining their corporate boundaries

## Readings
### hypothes.is
As you go through each lesson sequence, you will be provided with links to various course readings. [Hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is/) is an open-source web annotation tool that will enable you to highlight, annotate and discuss these course readings with your classmates in context (i.e. using a social layer on top of each website).\
For the purposes of this Specialization, we have created a group called “[BRMOOC](https://hypothes.is/groups/xR76zqDE/brmooc).” When annotating, please make sure that our group name is properly selected.\
